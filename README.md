NZBGetScripts
=============
These are scripts for the Usenet downloader NZBGet (http://nzbget.sourceforge.net).

# NotifyMyAndroid
This script pushes a notification to a NotifyMyAndroid account when a download completes. http://www.notifymyandroid.com/

# NotifyXBMC
This script can update one or more XBMC Frodo (12.0) clients when a download completes. It can display a message on the screen and/or update the library to immediately add the new download. http://xbmc.org/

# FailureEmail
An expansion on the built-in Email script, this allows an email to be sent only in the event of a download/repair/unpack's failure and not when a download succeeded.
